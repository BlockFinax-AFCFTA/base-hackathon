# BlockFinaX Document Management System

## Overview

The Document Management System is a core component of the BlockFinaX platform, providing secure, efficient handling of all trade-related documentation. The system enables users to store, share, and verify documents with an immutable audit trail, ensuring authenticity and compliance throughout the trade lifecycle.

## Key Features

### Document Storage and Organization

- **Hierarchical Organization**: Documents can be organized by contract, transaction, or independent categories
- **Reference Number System**: Each document receives a unique reference number in the format DOC-YYYY-XXXXX
- **Metadata Tagging**: Extensive metadata support including document type, issuer, recipient, and custom tags
- **Search and Filtering**: Advanced search capabilities with filtering by status, type, date, and reference number
- **Grid and List Views**: Flexible viewing options with customizable display preferences

### Document Status Tracking

Documents progress through a defined lifecycle with the following statuses:

1. **Draft**: Initial document creation and editing stage
2. **Pending Review**: Document submitted for approval by relevant parties
3. **Approved**: Document has been verified and approved by all required parties
4. **Rejected**: Document has been rejected and requires revision
5. **Expired**: Document has passed its validity date and is no longer active

Each status change is recorded with timestamp and user information, creating a complete audit trail.

### Document Sharing and Permissions

- **Granular Access Control**: Define precise permissions for each user or group
- **Password Protection**: Option to password-protect shared documents
- **Expiration Settings**: Set time limits on document access
- **Permission Types**:
  - View Only: Recipient can only view the document
  - Download: Recipient can download the document
  - Edit: Recipient can make changes to the document
  - Sign: Recipient can digitally sign the document
- **Activity Tracking**: Full visibility of who accessed, viewed, or modified shared documents

### Document Verification System

The platform offers three methods of document verification to ensure authenticity:

1. **Hash Verification**:
   - Each document is assigned a unique cryptographic hash (SHA-256)
   - Hash values are stored on the blockchain for immutable record-keeping
   - Any document alteration will change the hash value, making tampering evident
   - Users can compare hash values to verify document integrity

2. **Blockchain Verification**:
   - Document hashes are anchored to the blockchain
   - Timestamp proof of document existence at a specific time
   - Immutable verification that cannot be altered or falsified
   - Public verification possible without revealing document contents

3. **Certificate Authority Verification**:
   - Integration with trusted third-party certificate authorities
   - Digital signature validation
   - Compliance with legal and regulatory standards
   - Enhanced trust for formal documentation

### Version Control

- **Automatic Versioning**: Each document update creates a new version while preserving previous versions
- **Version Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of different document versions
- **Changelog**: Detailed record of changes between versions
- **Rollback Capability**: Option to restore previous document versions as needed

## User Flows

### Uploading a New Document

1. User navigates to the Documents section
2. Clicks "Upload Document" button
3. Uploads file or creates document using integrated editor
4. Adds metadata including:
   - Document title
   - Document type
   - Related contract (optional)
   - Tags for categorization
5. Sets document status (typically Draft)
6. Submits the document to the system
7. System generates a unique reference number and records upload timestamp

### Sharing a Document

1. User selects document from document list
2. Clicks "Share" in document actions
3. Selects recipient(s) from contacts or enters email addresses
4. Sets permission levels for each recipient
5. Configures additional security options:
   - Password protection
   - Expiration period
   - Download limitations
6. Adds optional message
7. Clicks "Share Document"
8. System generates secure sharing link
9. Recipients receive notification with access instructions

### Verifying Document Authenticity

1. User selects document requiring verification
2. Clicks "Verify Authenticity" in document actions
3. System displays document information including reference number and hash
4. User selects verification method:
   - Hash Verification
   - Blockchain Verification
   - Certificate Authority
5. For hash verification, user can optionally enter a hash value to compare
6. System performs selected verification process
7. Verification results displayed with:
   - Success/failure status
   - Timestamp of verification
   - Details of verification method
   - Additional information if verification failed

### Document Approval Workflow

1. Document creator changes status from Draft to Pending Review
2. Designated approvers receive notification
3. Approvers review document and can:
   - Approve (changing status to Approved)
   - Reject with comments (changing status to Rejected)
   - Request modifications (keeping status as Pending Review with comments)
4. Document creator receives notification of status change
5. If approved, document becomes available for final use
6. If rejected, creator can modify and resubmit

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Architecture

- **Encrypted Storage**: All documents are encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
- **Distributed Storage**: Files distributed across secure cloud storage with redundancy
- **Metadata Database**: Document metadata stored in PostgreSQL database
- **Blockchain Integration**: Hash values and verification records stored on blockchain

### Security Measures

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All documents encrypted during transmission and storage
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions with multi-factor authentication for sensitive documents
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all document activities
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Automatic backup and recovery systems
- **Compliance Features**: Retention policies and legal hold capabilities

### Integration Capabilities

The Document Management System integrates with other BlockFinaX modules:

- **Contract Management**: Documents can be attached to specific contracts
- **Wallet System**: Transaction records can include document references
- **Trade Finance**: Financing applications can include required documentation
- **Logistics**: Shipping documents can be linked to logistics bookings
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Documents can be checked against regulatory requirements

## Best Practices

### Document Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names that identify the document purpose
- Include relevant identifiers like contract numbers or dates
- Avoid special characters that might cause system compatibility issues
- Consider including document version in the filename

### Metadata Management

- Apply consistent tags and categories across documents
- Use standardized document types from the platform's taxonomy
- Include all relevant parties in document metadata
- Update metadata when document purpose or status changes

### Security Recommendations

- Use strong passwords for protected documents
- Set appropriate expiration times for shared documents
- Regularly review access permissions
- Verify document authenticity before taking action based on content

### Compliance Considerations

- Be aware of document retention requirements in your jurisdiction
- Consider legal admissibility requirements for electronic documents
- Implement appropriate access controls for sensitive information
- Maintain clear audit trails for regulatory purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Document upload fails
**Solution**: Check file size and format compatibility, ensure stable internet connection

**Issue**: Document verification fails
**Solution**: Verify the document hasn't been modified, check if the correct verification method is selected

**Issue**: Recipients cannot access shared documents
**Solution**: Verify recipient email address, check if the sharing link has expired, confirm permission settings

**Issue**: Document status cannot be changed
**Solution**: Ensure you have appropriate permissions, check if there are pending approval requirements
