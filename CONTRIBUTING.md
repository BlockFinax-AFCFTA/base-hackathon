## Smart Contract Development

Blockfinax relies on secure and efficient smart contracts for its core escrow and trade finance functionality. When contributing to blockchain-related features:

### Smart Contract Development Process

1. **Design Phase**
   - Document contract specifications with clear business requirements
   - Create detailed technical specification including state variables, functions, and events
   - Review design with at least two other developers before implementation
   - Conduct threat modeling to identify potential security vulnerabilities

2. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Follow Solidity style guide and best practices
   - Use the latest stable compiler version
   - Implement proper access control mechanisms (e.g., OpenZeppelin's AccessControl)
   - Use established libraries when possible (e.g., OpenZeppelin for standard functionality)
   - Comment all functions, parameters, return values, and complex logic
   - Emit events for all state changes to facilitate off-chain tracking
   - Implement proper error handling with descriptive custom errors

3. **Security Best Practices**
   - Use reentrancy guards for external calls (check-effects-interactions pattern)
   - Avoid using `tx.origin` for authentication
   - Protect against integer overflow/underflow
   - Validate all inputs and enforce bounds checking
   - Minimize trust in external contracts
   - Implement circuit breakers (pause functionality) for emergency situations
   - Consider front-running attack vectors
   - Use time locks for critical state changes
   - Apply principle of least privilege for all roles

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Achieve 100% code coverage for all smart contracts
   - Include unit tests for all functions and edge cases
   - Implement integration tests for contract interactions
   - Conduct formal verification when possible
   - Perform fuzz testing for critical functions
   - Test on testnet before mainnet deployment
   - Document all test scenarios and their coverage

5. **Gas Optimization Techniques**
   - Use appropriate data types (uint256 is often more gas efficient than smaller integers)
   - Batch operations to reduce transaction costs
   - Pack related storage variables to minimize storage slots
   - Use calldata instead of memory for function parameters when possible
   - Avoid unnecessary storage writes
   - Cache storage values in memory when used multiple times
   - Implement gas usage benchmarks and document them

6. **Deployment Process**
   - Use a well-documented and repeatable deployment process
   - Verify all contract source code on block explorers
   - Document all constructor parameters and initialization values
   - Implement a staged deployment for complex systems
   - Conduct post-deployment verification tests
   - Document contract addresses and deployment details

7. **Upgradeability Considerations**
   - Decide on an upgradeability pattern (proxy, diamond, etc.) early in design
   - Document upgrade paths and governance procedures
   - Test upgrade procedures thoroughly
   - Implement secure upgrade mechanisms with proper time locks and multi-sig

## Security Considerations

Security is a critical aspect of Blockfinax as we handle sensitive financial transactions and trade data. All contributors must adhere to the following security guidelines:

### General Security Principles

- Never commit secrets, credentials, or private keys to the repository
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all system components
- Implement defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Validate and sanitize all user input at every layer (client, API, database)
- Use proper authentication and authorization for all resources
- Always verify that security controls cannot be bypassed

### Application Security Requirements

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Implement multi-factor authentication where appropriate
  - Use JWT with appropriate expiration and refresh token rotation
  - Implement proper session management with secure cookies
  - Define and enforce clear role-based access control
  - Log all authentication events for audit purposes

- **Data Protection**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
  - Implement proper key management practices
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
  - Apply HTTPS/TLS for all communications
  - Implement content security policy (CSP) headers
  - Apply appropriate data retention and deletion policies

- **Secure Development Practices**:
  - Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
  - Perform thorough code reviews with security focus
  - Conduct regular security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing)
  - Maintain a vulnerability management process
  - Implement secure dependency management
  - Document security assumptions and requirements

### Blockchain-Specific Security

- Protect private keys with hardware security modules when possible
- Implement secure wallet management practices
- Consider frontrunning, replay attacks, and other blockchain-specific threats
- Design smart contracts with security as the primary concern
- Apply formal verification where possible for critical contracts
- Implement circuit breakers and emergency response procedures

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** disclose it publicly in GitHub issues or discussions
2. Send details directly to security@blockfinax.com with "SECURITY VULNERABILITY" in the subject
3. Include detailed reproduction steps and impact assessment
4. Our security team will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
5. We will work with you to understand, validate, and address the issue
6. We follow a responsible disclosure process and will keep you informed

## Performance Engineering

Performance is a critical aspect of Blockfinax as our platform handles high-value international trade transactions that require responsive and reliable execution. All contributors should apply performance engineering principles to their work:

### Frontend Performance

  - Design efficient API endpoints that minimize database operations
  - Apply caching strategies (Redis, in-memory) for frequently accessed data
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent resource exhaustion

- **Blockchain Interaction**:
  - Minimize on-chain operations to reduce gas costs and latency
  - Implement efficient batching for blockchain transactions
  - Use event listening instead of polling where appropriate

### Performance Testing

- Establish performance baselines and KPIs for key user journeys
- Implement automated performance testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor client-side performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)
- Conduct regular load and stress testing for critical systems
- Document performance requirements and test results

### Monitoring and Optimization

- Implement proper application performance monitoring (APM)
